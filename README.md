# Direction-Aware and Line-of-Sight Constrained Path Planning for Maze Traversal

This repository presents a lightweight, efficient framework combining **Direction-Aware Path Planning Approach (DAPPA)** and **Constrained Line-of-Sight Path Optimization (CLOSPO)** to systematically refine paths generated by classical graph-based planners. The objective is to enhance path quality, improving smoothness, reducing unnecessary turns, and shortening trajectories, **without introducing significant computational overhead**.

Unlike learning-based methods that require large datasets and heavy training, this approach enhances the reliability and generalizability of classical algorithms such as **A\***, **Dijkstra**, **BFS**, and **DFS** with minimal additional complexity.

## Algorithmic Pipeline

1. **Initial Path Generation**  
   Generate an initial feasible path using classical graph search algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, BFS, or DFS.

2. **Direction-Aware Path Planning Approach (DAPPA)**  
   Refine the path by systematically removing unnecessary turning points based on local directionality checks.

3. **Constrained Line-of-Sight Path Optimization (CLOSPO)**  
   Further shorten and simplify the path by skipping intermediate waypoints when direct line-of-sight is available under constrained movement rules.

4. **Trajectory Smoothing**  
   Apply smoothing techniques to the refined path:
   - **P-Controller Based Smoothing:** Simple proportional control-based path fitting to reduce oscillations and correct sharp deviations.
   - **Bézier Curve Smoothing:** Fit a cubic Bézier curve through the path points for smooth polynomial interpolation.
   - **Rational Quadratic Bézier Curve Smoothing:** More flexible Bézier variant allowing weighted control points for even finer control of curve shape and path curvature.

5. **Execution**  
   The final smoothed path can be directly used for robot motion execution in simulation or real environments.

## Algorithmic Overview

### Direction-Aware Path Planning Approach (DAPPA)

**Purpose**  
Refine the path by reducing unnecessary directional changes and removing redundant waypoints.

**Method**  
- Traverse through each sequence of three consecutive points.
- Identify if the direction remains unchanged between the segments.
- Eliminate the middle point if the trajectory is linear.

**Benefits**  
- Reduces unnecessary mechanical movement.
- Improves smoothness and travel efficiency.

### Constrained Line-of-Sight Path Optimization (CLOSPO)

**Purpose**  
Further streamline the path by directly connecting waypoints that are visible to each other under constrained movement checks.

**Method**  
- Check the line-of-sight between non-consecutive points.
- Skip intermediate nodes if the path between them is obstacle-free.
- Ensure no collisions by performing grid-cell visibility validation.

**Benefits**  
- Shortens the total path length.
- Produces continuous trajectories better suited for robotic systems.
